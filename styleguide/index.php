				<h1 class="section-heading">Unity Style Guide</h1>
					<p>
					The purpose of these documents are to outline the appropriate style usage and CSS Classes to be used in coordination with the <strong>Unity Theme</strong> for Stony Brook University. 
					</p>

					<p><strong>Unity</strong> is DoIT's attempt to define a set of consistent standards for designing modern websites that align with the University's branding guidelines. We are developing <strong>Unity</strong> in a modular way to ensure that it can support varying Content Management Systems and Web Frameworks.</p>

					<p>This document will be updated frequently to keep up with additional style requests and demands.  

					<p>You can clone a copy of <strong>Unity</strong> at <a href="http://www.github.com/SBUDoIT">SBUDoIT's GitHub</a>

				<p>Stony Brook University's web presence is enmormous and is only growing larger. Branding, styling and accessibility compliance across our web properities is inconsistent (at best). And we are seeing an increase in the number of mobile computing devices.</p>
				<p>Many departments, teams and individuals (faculty, staff and students) have a need for a web presence, often times the work of maintaining the web server, creating the sites design, developing the information architecture and maintaining its content falls on one person, with varying ability in this area and who is often overwhelmed by the amount of work required to properly maintain a large site. </p>

				<p><strong>This model is inefficent.</strong> In attempt to alliviate some of the administrative overhead, DoIT has rolled out platforms like <a href="http://you.stonybrook.edu">SB You</a> and offers <a href="http://it.stonybrook.edu/services/drupal-content-management-system">Drupal Hosting and Consulting Services</a>. The External Communications Group also offers <a href="http://it.stonybrook.edu/services/omniupdate">OmniUpdate</a> as a CMS Option. There are still many sites who's needs aren't completely met by these "boxed" solutions.</p>

				<p>Rather than constantly reinvent the wheel, I think we attempt to rally together around the <strong>User Experience & Interface</strong> and attempt to define a consistent set of guidelines and principals we can all follow across our sites.</p>

					<p>
					 I want to create rich and rewarding web experiences for our users (faculty, staff, students, prospective students and other members of the campus community). 
					</p>
					<p><strong>I pledge that sites using this theme and following the guidelines provided will:</strong></p>
					<ul>
					<li>Be Section 508 Compliant</li>
					<li>Follow University Branding Guidelines</li>
					<li>Provide the same great experience to desktop, widescreen and mobile users</li>
					<li>Fully Support Modern Browsers (IE10, Chrome, FF, Safari)</li>
					<li>Degrade Nicely on legacy browsers (IE7-9)</li>
					<li>Be built upon modern UX and Design Tools like SASS, GRUNT</li>
					<li>Be backend independent</li>
					<li>Be extensible and flexible to allow for custom modifications</li>
					<li>Incorporate feedback and modifications from developers like YOU</li>
					</ul>
