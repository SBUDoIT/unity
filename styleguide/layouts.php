			<p class="intro-text"> We currently follow 4 main breakpoints for our content: 
			<strong>1280, 960, 640 and 320px</strong> Notice that these are multiples of one another. This allows us to build blocks that will stack and act consistently across each of our viewports.

			<h1 class="heading-styleguide">Sections</h1>

			<p class="intro-text">
			Sections will always take 100% of the parents available width. The Left side bar and right side bar (when available) will constrain the width of each section appropriately.
