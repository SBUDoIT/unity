                                Unity is an attempt to define a set of consistent standards for designing modern websites that align with the University's branding guidelines. We are developing Unity in a modular way to ensure that it can support varying Content Management Systems and Web Frameworks.

                            <h3>Motivations</h3>
                            <p>
                                Stony Brook University's web presence is enmormous and is only growing larger. Branding, styling and accessibility compliance across our web properities is inconsistent (at best). And we are seeing an increase in the number of mobile computing devices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many departments, teams and individuals (faculty, staff and students) have a need for a web presence, often times the work of maintaining the web server, creating the sites design, developing the information architecture and maintaining its content falls on one person, with varying ability in this area and who is often overwhelmed by the amount of work required to properly maintain a large site.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Our current web dev support model is inefficent.</strong> Our teams cannot easily take advantage of the front-end work each of us is doing and because of this our sites often fall out of sync with branding requirements and designs, leading to inconsistent experiences for our end users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rather than constantly reinvent the wheel with each new project, Unity will provide a framework that our sites can start with in an effort to decrease our workload and increase user satisfaction and compliance with University policies.
