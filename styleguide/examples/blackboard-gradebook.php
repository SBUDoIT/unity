					A major component of Blackboard is the Grade Center, which is an online spreadsheet that allows instructors to grade assignments as well as manage grades for their students.  Through the Grade Center, instructors can organize their grades into columns, each representing a different assignment, as well as create calculated columns to run functions such as finding an average quiz grade or for finding a student's weighted total based on specific grading criteria.
					</p>
					
					<p class="intro-text">
					Important: Grades from Blackboard are not automatically uploaded to SOLAR at the end of the semester.  Instructors need to manually input students' grades into SOLAR at the end of every semester.
